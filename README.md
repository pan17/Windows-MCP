**Windows-MCP** is a lightweight, open-source project that enables seamless integration between AI agents and the Windows operating system. Acting as an MCP server bridges the gap between LLMs and the Windows operating system, allowing agents to perform tasks such as **file navigation, application control, UI interaction, QA testing,** and more.

mcp-name: io.github.CursorTouch/Windows-MCP

## Updates
- Added VM support for Windows-MCP. Check (windowsmcp.io)[https://windowsmcp.io/] for more details.
- Windows-MCP reached `2M+ Users` in [Claude Desktop Extensiosn](https://claude.ai/directory). 
- Try out [🪟Windows-Use](https://pypi.org/project/windows-use/), an agent built using Windows-MCP.
- Windows-MCP is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/windows-mcp/) (thus supports `uvx windows-mcp`)
- Windows-MCP is added to [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry)

### Supported Operating Systems

- Windows 7
- Windows 8, 8.1
- Windows 10
- Windows 11

## ✨ Key Features

- **Seamless Windows Integration**  
  Interacts natively with Windows UI elements, opens apps, controls windows, simulates user input, and more.

- **Use Any LLM (Vision Optional)**
   Unlike many automation tools, Windows-MCP doesn't rely on any traditional computer vision techniques or specific fine-tuned models; it works with any LLMs, reducing complexity and setup time.

- **Rich Toolset for UI Automation**  
  Includes tools for basic keyboard, mouse operation and capturing window/UI state.

- **Lightweight & Open-Source**  
  Minimal dependencies and easy setup with full source code available under MIT license.

- **Customizable & Extendable**  
  Easily adapt or extend tools to suit your unique automation or AI integration needs.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., from one mouse click to the next) ranges from **0.2 to 0.9 secs**, and may slightly vary based on the number of active applications and system load, also the inferencing speed of the llm.

- **DOM Mode for Browser Automation**  
  Special `use_dom=True` mode for State-Tool that focuses exclusively on web page content, filtering out browser UI elements for cleaner, more efficient web automation.

## 🛠️Installation

**Note:** When you install this MCP server for the first time it may take a minute or two because of installing the dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. In the first run the server may timeout ignore it and restart it.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- UV (Package Manager) from Astra, install with `pip install uv` or `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- `English` as the default language in Windows preferred else disable the `App-Tool` in the MCP Server for Windows with other languages.
- **(Optional) OCR Support** — To use the `use_ocr=True` option in the Snapshot tool, install Tesseract OCR:
  ```powershell
  winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR
  ```

## 🖥️ Modes

Windows-MCP supports two operating modes: **Local** (default) and **Remote**.

### Local Mode (Default)

In local mode, Windows-MCP runs directly on your Windows machine and exposes its tools to the connected MCP client. This is the standard setup for personal use.

```shell
# Runs with stdio transport (default)
uvx windows-mcp

# Or with SSE/Streamable HTTP for network access
uvx windows-mcp --transport sse --host localhost --port 8000
uvx windows-mcp --transport streamable-http --host localhost --port 8000
```

No additional environment variables are needed. The MCP client connects directly to the server.

### Remote Mode

In remote mode, Windows-MCP acts as a **proxy** that connects to the [windowsmcp.io](https://windowsmcp.io) enabling cloud-hosted Windows automation. This is designed for scenarios where the MCP client is remote and connects through the dashboard, which routes requests to a Windows VM running Windows-MCP.

**Required environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MODE` | Set to `remote` |
| `SANDBOX_ID` | The sandbox/VM identifier from the dashboard |
| `API_KEY` | Your Windows-MCP API key |

**Example configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "windows-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MODE": "remote",
        "SANDBOX_ID": "your-sandbox-id",
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Transport Options

| Transport | Flag | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `stdio` (default) | `--transport stdio` | Direct connection from MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc. |
| `sse` | `--transport sse --host HOST --port PORT` | Network-accessible via Server-Sent Events |
| `streamable-http` | `--transport streamable-http --host HOST --port PORT` | Network-accessible via HTTP streaming (recommended for production) |

## 📊 Telemetry

Windows-MCP collects usage data to help improve the MCP server. No personal information, no tool arguments, no outputs are tracked.

To disable telemetry, add the following to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "windows-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed information on what data is collected and how it is handled, please refer to the [Telemetry and Data Privacy](SECURITY.md#telemetry-and-data-privacy) section in our Security Policy.

## 📝 Limitations

- Selecting specific sections of the text in a paragraph, as the MCP is relying on a11y tree. (⌛ Working on it.)
- `Type-Tool` is meant for typing text, not programming in IDE because of it types program as a whole in a file. (⌛ Working on it.)
- This MCP server can't be used to play video games 🎮.
